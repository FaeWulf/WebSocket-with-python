# Simple WebSocket with python

## Description 
  My first python project ever during school learning.
  
## Usage
You can get a feel of how to use the websocket server by running
```
python index.py
```

## API
```
WebsocketServer
```

## Config.py
```
host = "localhost"          // Server IP
port = 80                   // Port
password = "admin"
username = "admin"
buffer_size = 1024 * 50     // Chunks size in chunked transfer method
```
 
## Useful information
* Communicate between modern web browers <-> socket server.
* Use HTTP protocol, a protocol at the application layer.
* Chunked transfer method.
* Simple case for both Post and Get method.
